## 1. Introduction and Overview

### 1.1. Welcome and System Introduction

**Welcome to Aire HPC Documentation**  
This repository contains the comprehensive documentation for the University of Leeds’ Aire HPC system. Aire is the latest high‑performance computing facility, launched on 6 February 2025, replacing the older ARC3 and ARC4 systems. It offers state‑of‑the‑art hardware, modernised software environments, and a range of support resources to ensure you can achieve efficient, high‑performance research computing.

*(Content from [welcome.md](#) is included here.)*  
For example, the welcome page describes major upgrades in computing power, memory and storage, and details the retirement of the ARC systems.

### 1.2. Getting Started with HPC

High Performance Computing (HPC) allows multiple processors to work on computationally intensive tasks concurrently, reducing processing times drastically. This section provides an introduction to HPC, explains the different types of jobs (serial, parallel, and multi‑node), and advises on when to utilise the HPC system.  
*(See [start.md](#) “Getting Started” content.)*

## 5. User Expectations, Rules and Data Policies

### 5.1. Operational Expectations

When using Aire, follow these guidelines to ensure optimal system performance:  
- Use scratch storage only for temporary files; do not treat it as permanent storage.  
- Request only the necessary resources for your jobs.  
- Do not run intensive tasks on login nodes.  
- Keep your SSH keys secure and update your contact information.  
*(Content from [expectations.md](#) is included.)*

### 5.2. Rules and Regulations

Users must ensure that their jobs are efficient and non‑disruptive. Failure to comply may result in job termination without warning.  
*(Content from [rules_regulations.md](#) is included.)*

### 5.3. Data Lifecycle Management

Guidelines cover the management of data throughout its lifecycle:  
- **Storage Tiers:** Scratch storage for temporary files, home directories for small essential files, and shared project storage for collaborative data.  
- **Best Practices:** Organise files using consistent folder structures, compress large datasets, and regularly back up important data.  
*(Content from [data_lifecycle_management.md](#) is included.)*

### 5.4. Filesystem Quotas

Each filesystem has quotas for disk space and file counts. For example:  
- **$HOME:** 30GB, 1,000,000 files  
- **$SCRATCH:** 1,000GB, 500,000 files  
Use the `quota -s` command to monitor your usage.  
*(Content from [filesystem_quotas.md](#) is included.)*

*(Content from [storage_overview.md](#) is included.)*

### 6.2. Data Sharing

Learn how to share files securely using Linux commands like `chmod`, `chown`, and `setfacl`. Examples include:  
```bash
cd /mnt/scratch/<username>
setfacl -m u:<target-username>:r-x .
```
*(Content from [data_sharing.md](#) is included.)*

### 6.3. Data Transfer Guidelines

For transferring data, use secure tools such as `scp` and `rsync`. Example commands:
```bash
scp -J username@rash.leeds.ac.uk test.dat username@login1.aire.leeds.ac.uk:/mnt/scratch/users/username
```
*(Content from [data_transfer.md](#) is included.)*
