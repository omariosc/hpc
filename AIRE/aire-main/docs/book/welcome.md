# Aire User Documentation

This site documents information relevant to users of Aire, the High Performance Computing (HPC) facility at the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk). It is oriented towards researchers with basic experience using a Unix-like command line interface (CLI).

Launched on the 6th of February 2025, Aire is the University of Leeds' latest HPC system, bringing cutting-edge computational power to support research across disciplines. With major upgrades in computing power, memory, and storage, Aire is set to enhance data processing and streamline research workflows.

```{admonition} Upgrading from ARC3 and ARC4
Aire is the new HPC system replacing the ARC3 and ARC4 systems. The new system significantly increases compute capacity for the community while delivering a modern, maintainable software and programming environment.

Please be aware that:

- New login and management nodes have been installed, meaning **users of the old systems need to [get a new account](getting_started/get_account.md) on Aire.**
- Storage is not shared between different systems, so **if you need to retain data from the old systems, you must transfer it yourself.**
```

```{admonition} ARC3 System Retirement Notice
The ARC3 system is now retired from service.
- 1st November 2024: ARC3 account registration period closed.
- 2nd December 2024: Batch and interactive access to all compute resources will be withdrawn.
- 1st March 2025: All access to the service will be withdrawn and physical decommissioning of the system will commence. Note that all data on this system will be lost at this point.
```

```{admonition} ARC4 System Retirement Notice
ARC4 will be completely shut down by June 2025. Note that all data on this system will be lost at that point. For more information about this decision, please see our [blog post](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/supporting-teaching/). The decommissioning timeline will be published shortly.
