## RSE

The Research Software Engineering (RSE) team is an important and essential part of the HPC and Research Computing ecosystem at the University. Their primary role is to provide support for research projects where there is a large computational component. They are able to give advice about planning your project and its computational requirements. But more importantly they can collaborate with you to perform major software and workflow development, including programming reviews, performance analysis, code modernisation and refactoring. The RSE team has its own website [here](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/).

The RSE team also hosts a [Research Computing Community](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ADhcafsOyYnWotrwqTZkjDpRhSp7Cemz4qQpZfk7G5v01%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=1ff8cb55-a479-4202-9dc4-a97891c03f42&tenantId=bdeaeda8-c81d-45ce-863e-5232a535b7cb), bringing together a broader network of individuals using HPC and engaging in research software development. If you're interested in HPC or research software development, we warmly invite you to join this community on Microsoft Teams.

## RIE

The Research Infrastructure Engineering (RIE) team also contributes to the HPC and Research Computing ecosystem at the University.
