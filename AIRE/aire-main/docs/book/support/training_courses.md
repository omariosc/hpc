# Training courses

To effectively use an HPC system like Aire, you’ll need certain skills, starting with a basic understanding of the Linux command line (the shell). This knowledge is essential for preparing and manipulating data, code, and scripts, as well as managing your work on the system. Familiarity with the Linux shell is a prerequisite for accessing Aire. If you’ve used other HPC systems before, you likely already have most of the necessary skills.

As you progress in your use of HPC, more advanced Linux skills may become necessary, including scripting and tools like `grep`, `awk`, and `sed`. If your work involves developing or maintaining code, proficiency in relevant programming languages will also be beneficial.

We offer regular training courses at the University, as well as access to courses hosted online or at other institutions. The curriculum and current course schedule are available [here](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/courses/).
