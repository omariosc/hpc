# Logging-on

To connect to the Aire platform, the steps vary depending on whether you are on the wired campus network or offsite/using Eduroam. If you are offsite, you must connect through the University's SSH gateway or use the University VPN. However, if you are on the campus network, no additional steps are required. The instructions below are organized based on whether you are connecting from on-campus or off-campus.

Connecting via Eduroam or from the NHS network in St James's University Hospital are considered off-site connections.
