## Prerequisites

The HPC systems run the Linux operating system. You should be familiar with using Linux at the command line level in order to run tasks. We provide periodic training sessions on "Introduction to Linux for HPC" to help you get started; you can find the link to the HPC0 training below. Much of the work done on HPC systems is scripted to automate many tasks, so understanding the basics is important and highly beneficial.

## User Accounts

Each user of the system has their own separate user account, which is linked to your University account. You must not share your accounts or passwords under any circumstances. There are data-sharing mechanisms to facilitate collaborative work, which are described in the file and data management section.
