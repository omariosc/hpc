# Storage and Filesystems

Aire has a large amount of local storage to support the demanding I/O characteristics and data volumes needed by HPC workloads. There are several different storage areas which are tuned for different I/O characteristics and usage patterns. By having different areas we can support the different types of I/O required for various parts of HPC workloads.

For more information about the different storage areas and when to use them, check out [File and Data Management](../usage/file_data_management/start.md).
